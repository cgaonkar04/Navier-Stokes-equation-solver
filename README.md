# Navier-Stokes-equation-solver
Solving top lid driven fluid flow by solving Navier-Stokes equtions and solving Navier Stokes equation using stable fluids method. The solution found using the stable fluids method is used to simulate fluid flow because of an upward driving force in the bottom of the fluid.
